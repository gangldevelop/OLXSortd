# OLXSortd 📧

**Smart Email Contact Management & Cold Outreach Tool for Outlook & Gmail**

OLXSortd is an intelligent email contact management system focused on **outreach to contacts that have been contacted before but haven't been contacted in a while**. The app analyzes your email interactions to automatically categorize contacts and helps you **follow up and check in with contacts to potentially restart old leads**. Built as an Outlook Add-in and Gmail extension, it identifies opportunities for re-engagement and streamlines your outreach efforts.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Contact Analysis
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorizes contacts into **Recent**, **In Touch**, and **Inactive** based on email interaction patterns
- **Response Rate Tracking**: Calculates response rates and engagement metrics for each contact
- **Behavioral Insights**: Analyzes email frequency, response times, and conversation patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses Web Workers for fast analysis of large contact databases (10,000+ contacts)

#### Contact Categorization Logic

The system automatically categorizes contacts based on their email interaction history:

**📅 Recent** (`recent`)
- Contacts with recent activity (last contact ≤ 30 days ago), OR
- High recent email frequency (≥ 2 emails in last 30 days), OR
- Good recent engagement (≥ 5 emails in last 90 days with ≥ 20% response rate)
- *These contacts are actively engaged and should be nurtured*

**🤝 In Touch** (`in_touch`)
- Contacts with good historical relationship (≥ 3 total emails)
- Decent responsiveness (≥ 30% response rate)
- Last contact within 120 days (about 4 months)
- *These contacts have a solid relationship but aren't very recent*

**⏰ Inactive** (`inactive`)
- All other contacts (long time since last touch or very sparse history)
- Contacts that haven't been contacted in a while or have minimal interaction
- *These contacts need re-engagement to restart old leads*

### 🔍 Advanced Search & Filtering
- **Real-time Search**: Search contacts by name, email, or company
- **Smart Filters**: Filter by response rate, last contact date, email count, and more
- **Flexible Sorting**: Sort by name, response rate, email count, or smart algorithm
- **Quick Access**: One-click filtering by contact category

### 📝 Professional Email Templates
- **Category-Specific Templates**: Tailored email templates dynamically matched to each contact's category (Recent, In Touch, Inactive)
- **Rich Text Editor**: Full-featured email composition with formatting options
- **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic placeholders (`{{name}}`, `{{senderName}}`, `{{company}}`, etc.) for personalization
- **Template Management**: Easy template selection and customization
- **Smart Template Selection**: When you click "Draft" on a contact, the suggested templates automatically match their category

#### Email Template System

Each contact category has specialized email templates:

- **Recent Contacts**: Templates for quick check-ins and maintaining active relationships
- **In Touch Contacts**: Templates for following up on previous conversations and maintaining momentum
- **Inactive Contacts**: Templates for reconnecting with contacts that have gone quiet, restarting old leads

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard
- **Contact Overview**: Visual summary of contact categories and metrics
- **Needs Attention**: Intelligently prioritized list of contacts requiring follow-up and re-engagement
- **Performance Metrics**: Response rates, engagement statistics, and trends
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time analysis progress with detailed status updates

#### "Needs Attention" Logic

The **Needs Attention** section identifies contacts that are prime candidates for outreach and re-engagement. This is the core feature designed to help you **restart old leads** and **follow up with contacts that haven't been contacted in a while**.

**Inclusion Criteria:**

A contact appears in "Needs Attention" if they meet ALL of the following:
1. ✅ Have been contacted before (`emailCount > 0`)
2. ✅ Have a last contact date recorded
3. ✅ Haven't been contacted in at least **30 days**
4. ✅ Not tagged as "crossware"

**Category-Specific Rules:**

- **Inactive Contacts**: All inactive contacts with email history are included
- **In Touch Contacts**: Included if last contact was **60+ days ago** (good history but needs check-in)
- **Recent Contacts**: Included if last contact was **30+ days ago** (catching slipping relationships early)

**Prioritization Algorithm:**

Contacts are sorted by priority (highest first):
1. **Response Rate** (highest first) - Contacts with better historical response rates are prioritized
2. **Email Count** (highest first) - Contacts with more email history indicate more valuable relationships
3. **Days Since Last Contact** (most urgent first) - Contacts that haven't been contacted for longer periods are prioritized

**Why This Works:**

- 🎯 **Catches slipping relationships early**: Includes recent contacts that are starting to go stale (30+ days)
- 💎 **Includes valuable relationships**: In Touch contacts with good history but need re-engagement (60+ days)
- 📊 **Data-driven prioritization**: Focuses on contacts most likely to respond (higher response rates and more history)
- ⏰ **Time-based filtering**: Only shows contacts that actually need attention (minimum 30 days threshold)

### 🚀 Performance Features
- **Quick Analysis**: Fast analysis of recent contacts (~30 seconds)
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full database analysis with Web Workers (~3-5 minutes)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of large datasets
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking during analysis

## 🧬 How It Works

### Contact Analysis Process

1. **Email Collection**: Fetches all email interactions from your Outlook/Gmail account
2. **Interaction Analysis**: For each contact, analyzes:
   - Total email count (sent and received)
   - Response rate (percentage of sent emails that received replies)
   - Days since last contact
   - Email frequency in last 30/90 days
   - Conversation threads and patterns
3. **Category Assignment**: Assigns each contact to Recent, In Touch, or Inactive based on the categorization logic
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates a confidence score (0-100) based on:
   - Amount of data available (more emails = higher confidence)
   - Recency of activity (recent activity = higher confidence)
   - Response rate (better response rate = higher confidence)
   - Category-specific adjustments
5. **Insights Generation**: Creates human-readable insights about each contact's communication patterns

### Analysis Metrics

The system calculates these key metrics for each contact:

- **Total Emails**: Total number of email interactions
- **Sent Emails**: Number of emails you sent to this contact
- **Received Emails**: Number of emails received from this contact
- **Response Rate**: Percentage of your sent emails that received replies (calculated thread-aware)
- **Days Since Last Contact**: Number of days since the last email interaction
- **Average Response Time**: Average time (in hours) for the contact to respond
- **Conversation Count**: Number of distinct email threads/conversations

## 📊 Performance

### Analysis Performance
- **Quick Mode**: ~200 emails analyzed in 30 seconds
- **Full Mode**: 10,000+ contacts analyzed in 3-5 minutes
- **Web Workers**: Background processing prevents UI blocking
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient memory usage for large datasets

### Optimization Features
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Memoized Calculations**: Cached analysis results for repeated operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized React rendering with proper keys
- **Thread-Aware Calculations**: Response rate calculation considers email threads for accuracy

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication with Microsoft and Google
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure storage
- **Permission Scoping**: Minimal required permissions for functionality

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: Contact analysis performed locally
- **No Data Storage**: No personal data stored on external servers
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS for all API communications
